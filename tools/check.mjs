//   node tools/check.mjs --quick     # skip the browser (static checks only)
//
// This exists because running the checks individually meant one of them could
// be skipped, and one of them was: a `git checkout` during an unrelated
// experiment reverted an import fix, split-parity still passed (it compares
// declaration bodies, and the bodies were fine), and the commit shipped a
// module importing a name that had moved. The page died at instantiation with
// "does not provide an export named 'resetCardUndoHistory'". Every check needed
// to catch it existed; nothing made running all of them the default.
//
// Each check answers a different question, and none of them subsumes another:
//
//   split-parity    is the code still the same code?
//   module-symbols  does every cross-module reference resolve?
//   css-parity      do the stylesheet slices still reassemble to the original?
//   port-sync       do the extension's copies still match?
//   boot-check      does it actually run?
